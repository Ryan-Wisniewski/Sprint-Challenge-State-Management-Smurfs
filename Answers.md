1. What problem does the context API help solve?

Context? Like provider? It gives the data to the highest level compoenent and will pass the data to where ever without all the props driling


1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

actions to the stuff to connect the compnent with data to the reducer. the reducer takes the state and makes chagnes, and the store hold that data on the provider to pass down to where ever you need.


1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

our application state is global, and your component state is local.


1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

allows us to return a frunction instead of the simple action.


1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

REDUX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Along with UseState. Those hooks were very easy and clean to understand. As someone with no xp i think it was nice to do the cirriculum this way. Redux because no more props drilling :) Being able to pass props anywhere I want is super convinient!
